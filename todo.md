- add "you have scrolled past 125,000 civilians"
- on mobile, how can it be made interactive? maybe clicking on a box -> viz slides to left, and the new screen from right has the popup data -> another screen (swiping to right) shows other info like "killed by coalition or terrorist"
- filters. be able to fiter incidents by "who killed them", "what weapons were used", etc

#reasoning

There was a [similar visualisation that we’d made, in which the data was separated by year](http://setwrite.in/_unicorns/IBC-20200418/). I prefer if the data is not separated by year, because:

- the loss of life was a continuous stream of violence;
- bullets and bombs that kill people did not differenciate between who they kill on Dec 31 and Jan 1; and
- the purpose of this visualisation is to visualise each violent incident (i.e., not to study, dissect, analyse or categorise the data) — it wants to affect the viewer in a way that graphs and charts can not do; and
- if this visualisation achieves its goal, then people should be motivated to visit IBC’s website and read the important articles / analyses that you’ve shared there.
