      <h1>the cost of war</h1>
      <p>the real cost of the iraq war was paid by civilians who were killed in the crossfire.</p>
      <p>in this project, a light flickers for each civilian death during the 2003â€“11 conflict in iraq. there are two lights: one representing civilian lives taken by the american coalition, and another that flickers when a civilian was killed by opposing forces.</p>
